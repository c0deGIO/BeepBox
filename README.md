This is a python script that takes as input a TuneShare save code (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/863714854/) and generates an `MP3` file using the basic wave types (`sine`, `square`, `triangle` and `sawtooth`).
The `TS_FamilyGuy.txt` text file contains a TuneShare save code of the Family Guy theme song. The `Export.mp3` is the MP3 generated by the script.
